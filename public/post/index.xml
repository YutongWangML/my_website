      <description>This is a collection of interesting written pieces publicly accessible on the internet, but not published in any journal/conference that I know of.
Lecture note from 2003 by Trevor Hastie, Slide 21: &amp;ldquo;SVMs are hot right now&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;
Lecture note by Anthony D. Rhodes, Slide 7: &amp;ldquo;Vapnik introduced SVMs in 1992, at which time they became wildly popular&amp;rdquo;
Article by John Mount titled: &amp;ldquo;How sure are you that large margin implies low VC dimension?</description>

      <description>In this previous post, we listed solvers for SVMs. The focus of this post is specialized to solvers for the Crammer-Singer and Weston-Watkins kernel SVMs.
Shark Solves both
Relevant papers Igel, Heidrich-Meisner, and Glasmachers (2008) is the paper that introduced the Shark package. (link to paper)
Dogan, Glasmachers, and Igel (2011) introduces S2DO. (link to paper)
Glasmachers and Dogan (2013) introduces ACF. link to paper
Do«ßan, Glasmachers, and Igel (2016) performs empirical studies of several SVM variants link to paper</description>

      <description>Set-up and notations Primal problem Dual problem Expression for the dual problem  Derivatives Coordinate descent in Shark Update of a single block dual variable Computing the step vector Greedy step size    In this blog post, we derive the dual problem for the Weston-Watkins support vector machine (SVM). The dual optimization for the Weston-Watkins SVM can be found in the literature, e.g., Keerthi et al. (2008) and Weston and Watkins (1999).</description>

      <description>The dual of the SVM without offset: \[ \max_{\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_n} \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j k(x_i,x_j) \quad \mbox{s.t.}\quad 0 \le \alpha_i \le C,\, \forall i=1,\dots,n \quad \quad \quad (QP)\]
Decomposition Optimizing \((QP)\) one \(\alpha_i\), or a few \(\alpha_i\)s, at a time.
 Working set selection The set \(I \subseteq \{1,\dots, n\}\) of dual variables that the decomposition optimization algorithm consider at a given time.
 Shrinking During optimization using decomposition method, a dual variable may converges to \(\alpha_i = 0\) or \(\alpha_i = C\) and stays there.</description>

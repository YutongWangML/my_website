The dual of the SVM without offset:
$$ \max_{\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_n} \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i  - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j k(x_i,x_j) \quad \mbox{s.t.}\quad  0 \le \alpha_i \le C,\, \forall i=1,\dots,n \quad \quad \quad (QP)$$

# Decomposition
Optimizing $(QP)$ one $\alpha_i$, or a few $\alpha_i$s, at a time.


# Working set selection

The set $I \subseteq \{1,\dots, n\}$ of dual variables that the decomposition optimization algorithm consider at a given time.



# Shrinking

During optimization using decomposition method, a dual variable may converges to $\alpha_i = 0$ or $\alpha_i = C$ and stays there.
Such a dual variable can be taken out of the optimization.

Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. 
My research is in machine learning. 
I am advised by 
[Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/)
and
[Wei Hu](https://weihu.me/).


Before my postdoc, I completed my PhD in ECE advised by
[Clay Scott](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/), also at the University of Michigan.

Prior to my PhD, I completed my masters in mathematics at [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/).

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
My advisors are Professors
[Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/), 
and
[Wei Hu](https://weihu.me/).
My research interests are in theoretical machine learning.
I also work on applications of machine learning to reconstructive spectroscopy systems and semiconductor devices, in collaboration with the research group of Professor [Pei-Cheng Ku](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~peicheng/).
I am grateful to be supported by the [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI Fellowship](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/schmidt-ai-in-science-postdocs/). 


Before my postdoc, I completed my PhD in ECE advised by Professor
[Clay Scott](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/), also at the University of Michigan.
Prior to my PhD, I obtained my masters in mathematics at [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/).

Hi! I am a sixth year PhD candidate in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/). 
My research is in machine learning. 
I am advised by [Clay Scott](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/).

## Research interests

I'm motivated by the following questions:
- How do **(partially) quantized neural networks** compare to their full-precision counterparts, from the point-of-view of optimization, function approximation, and generalization?
- Can we close the gap between **multiclass** and **binary** SVMs? (In terms of theory and availability of solvers)
